This page shows a list of paper deadlines in HCI journals/conferences and related fields.
    
    
## Notes:
  
I had been originally making this list for internal members of our lab.  

Please note that:
<ul>
	<li>This list is based on my personal interest, and I do not intend to evaluate or rank the journals/conferences.</li>
	<li>Deadlines tend to be extended, so please make sure about the actual deadline by yourself. I am not responsible to ensure the actual final dates of the deadlines.</li>
</ul>
